                    <p>
                        Autumn is a motivated software developer with a fullstack
                        software education. She recently graduated from Cal Poly Humboldt
                        with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and is excited
                        to gain experience working outside of education and begin 
                        navigating the complex challenges of real-world product
                        development and software maintenance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since gradution Autumn has devoted herself to mastering diverse
                        coding languages and staying up to date with software development
                        research and techniques. Ultimately she would like to earn a
                        master's degree, and until that time comes she aims to stay
                        competitive, contribute to existing software, and advance her
                        career through professional experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of working on her personal stretch project, Autumn enjoys
                        working with her hands. She is often researching gardening topics,
                        seeking new crochet projects, and looking for new meals to
                        attempt in the kitchen. Once she has the means to attend further
                        education, she would like to attend courses in Construction
                        Technology to gain useful skills in home improvement.
